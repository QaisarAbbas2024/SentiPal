## 🚀 Project Description
We’re excited to present our hackathon project — SentiPal, your emotional AI companion. In a world full of productivity-focused AI tools, SentiPal brings back the soul. It's designed to vibe with you, laugh with you, and support your emotions in a way that feels unmistakably human.

### 🧠 What Does It Do?
**SentiPal** is a chatbot with a twist. It doesn't just talk — it feels. It detects your emotions using natural language processing and responds with empathy, humor, or support. Whether you want a joke, a game, or some comforting advice, SentiPal is here to make your day better. It even celebrates with confetti 🎉, balloons 🎈, or snow ❄️ to match your mood ✨!

---

### 💡 What Inspired It?
We were inspired by those moments when life feels a little heavy — when all you want is someone to talk to, even if it’s a quirky AI. We wanted to create a chaotic but kind companion that brings joy, acknowledges feelings, and reacts like a friend. This project is our way of blending emotional intelligence with artificial intelligence.

### 🎯 Hackathon Track
We’re submitting to the **"✨ Make Anything, But Make it YOU"** track of the [CS Girlies Hackathon](https://csgirlies.devpost.com/) hosted on DevPost.
Why? Because SentiPal reflects our personality and emotions. It’s quirky, soulful, sometimes silly — and unmistakably us. This track encourages creativity over complexity, and that’s where SentiPal truly shines.
